# MoonbounceLibrary
## This project is currently under development

MoonbounceLibrary is a library for configuring a VPN with Pluggable Transport support designed to connect to [Persona](https://www.github.com/OperatorFoundation/Persona) servers. The goal of Moonbounce is to provide a usability-focused, streamlined user experience to using PT-enabled VPNs.

### VPNs on macOS

The preferred method for VPN integration on macOS is now to use the NetworkExtension framework to configure system VPN settings, as well as to implement an application's custom VPN protocol.
